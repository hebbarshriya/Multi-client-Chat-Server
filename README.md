## MULTI-CLIENT CHAT SERVER

This is a chat server where multiple clients can connect to a common server to communicate with other clients on the same network.

# Features:
1. Peer-to-peer message transfer
2. Broadcast message transfer
3. Broadcast on join/leave (all other clients get a message when a new client joins/leaves the chat)
4. Print online users (the client gets a list of others who are already logged in on entering the server)
5. Text, document, image, audio and video transfer capabilities.
